establishing new connections to the postgres db is expensive 
whereas keeping the connections to the psotgres db is a process in itself and takes memory
therefore server_idle_timeout is set to 1 hour...if connection i unused for one hour, remove it

pool_mode = transaction to not block that connection to the pgbouncer by that client 
the connection is disregarded with the client once the otuput of the query is returned
in our code, we are doign that ourselves as well

we also specify a server_lifetime to disregard any connection occouring for more than one hour. 
this is to avoid memory bloat and releasign resources to the os

pooling means keeping backend connections open longer so they can be reused instead of creating a new one for every client request.
