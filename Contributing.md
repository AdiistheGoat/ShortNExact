* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable

response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
